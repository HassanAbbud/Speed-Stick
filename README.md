1. ## <a name="_toc198658431"></a>Game Concept
Speed Stick is a 2D up-scroller game where you must climb levels upwards with a timer. The player will have tools at its disposition to reach certain platforms, but the main mechanic will be jumping and sticking to walls that are the same color as the player’s side.

   1. ## <a name="_toc198658433"></a>Cube sides
Each side of the player cube will have a different color, that will match the color of some walls, the player can rotate the cube in any direction like how pieces are rotated in *Tetris.*
1. ## <a name="_toc198658434"></a>Jumping
Main way of movement, the player will be able to jump and move left or right to reach platforms and ultimately reach the goal.
1. ## <a name="_toc198658435"></a>Snapping
When the side of the cube is the same as the wall in front of the cube the player can press into the walls direction to snap into that wall and regain the ability to jump from there.

   1. ## <a name="_toc198658437"></a>Colored walls
These walls will allow the player to stick to them if the cube’s side is the same as the wall, otherwise the cube will slide down.
1. ## <a name="_toc198658438"></a>Neutral walls
These walls will have a neutral color and will serve as obstacles for the player, they won’t be “stickable” under normal conditions see [*5. Power Ups*](#_power_ups).
